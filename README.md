Add the folder to your libraries folder to use it and include it with #include <FlippedLCD.h>
usage:
flippedLCD("string", row int, col int); 
keep in mind it clears the screen and doesnt do anything smart to not count spaces as chars, so it can only print up to 8 chars at once.
Feel free to use my letters for other things or make it better
